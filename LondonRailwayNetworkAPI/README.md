## London Railway Network API

### This project is an implementation of a Railway API which determines the shortest path between 2 stations, and tackles a variation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) 

This implementation explores the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for the shortest path taken, Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest distance between two stations, and a nearest neighbour (NN) algorithm with heuristics for the TSP. 

The main program is stored in a Jupyter Notebook in /src, together with test files for the algorithms used. Also included is the report which discusses the choice of algorithms used, as well as the experimental performance of the implementations. There are also data files for the stations, and images of performance graphs included.
