# AdminUI for simulating integration

This was designed to simulate actual integration with a NHS service.

## Requirements

- nodejs v16 or above
- npm v8 or above

## Execute and deploy the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the required node_modules for the app

### `npm run start`

Launches the app in port 3000

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
The build folder can then be deployed to servers or served locally by using `npm install -g serve` and `serve -s build`
