## Convex Hull Algorithms Project

### This project involves the analyses of the Jarvis March and Graham Scan algorithms, and an improved version of the Graham Scan using heuristics.

Given a set of points on a Cartesian plane, the convex hull algorithm finds the outermost perimeter that contains all the line segments of connecting any pair of its points. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull)

This project aims to implement and analyse two convex hull algorithms: Jarvis March and Graham Scan. The report presents the results of the average and worst case scenarios of both implementations, and analyses the theoretical and experimental performance shown in the graphs. The improved Graham Scan with heuristics is also included to highlight the differences in experimental performance between the original and the improved version. 

The algorithms are implemented in Jupyter notebooks in /src. Folders /jarvis and /graham are the original code developed and implemented individually before synthesising them.
