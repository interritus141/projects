## Inventory Web Application

### Purpose: A simple inventory system that allows a user to input different categories of items in their inventory.

On the main menu, the user is able to see the address of the main menu webpage, as well as the link to access the inventory. After which the user is brought to the inventory lists page, 
where they can add their own item categories and a new list page for that category is generated. 

They can also delete categories and rename them, as well as search for a particular list. When the link to a category is clicked, the user then accesses the item list page where they 
can add items to that category, which includes the URL or image if they wish. The user can also delete, rename or edit the item, based on the name of the item. A search input is also 
included to allow users to search for their item. 

All data that is added, removed, or edited is handled by saving and loading from Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files in the database package, and the server constantly updates the 
database and the webpage every time new data is passed from the user.

A report on the program is also included. This report provides a UML class diagram, and discusses the design process and evaluation of the program.
